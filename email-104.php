                                            <h4>Tenant Enquiries</h4>
                                            Due to the policy of realestate.com.au our company details are displayed on your property advertisement for each website. In order to get all enquiries to you as quick as possible, these are our procedures:
                                    

<br />
<br /><span class="black"><u>Phone Calls:</u></span> 
<br />When we receive a phone call from a tenant we text them your name and phone number immediately, so they intern can call you straight away. 
<br /><br />
As a bonus, we take the perspective tenants name and phone number during the call and immediately email you their details after the call. So if you miss their call for whatever reason, you are able to retrieve their contact details and call them if needed.
<br />
<br /><span class="black"><u>Emails:</u></span> 
<br />When a prospective tenant asks a question through email using any of the 7 websites, we automatically forward that email to you.
<h4>Editing your advertisement</h4>
You can edit your advertisement at any time, the same way you created your advertisement. Except you don't have to pay again. 
<br />
<br />After selecting 'Advertise Property', you just need to click the large green button 'Republish Changes' or select 'Republish' from the drop down menu from your Rent My Estate account.  
<br />
<br />You can advertise your property for as long as it takes to find your tenants. Every 30 days we ask you to extend your advertisement (for free) if you still have not found a tenant. 
<br />
<br />Good luck with finding tenants, if you have any questions we're always here to help, you can call us on 1300 654 600 or email us anytime.
